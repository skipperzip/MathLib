The goal of my production was to create AI that would chase the player.

The main problem with this was my Vec2 library didn't have the proper constructors that could convert the floats to Vec2 (for some reason).
After making it the AI was actually quite simple.

The AI is not very smart and it just sort of aggressively chases the player and rushes past them quite often.
Watching them is pretty fun though so I added a changable camera so you can watch them.
Pressing 1, 2, or 3 will change the camera.
