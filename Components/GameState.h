/*
Basic structure of an application state.
Whether it's a menu, game, pause, victory screen;
the same basic concepts all work within a
finite state machine.

We don't need /all/ of them for /every/ state,
but it's generally useful to keep these steps in mind
when creating any kind of object.

	init
	- Called once at application start.
	- Used for loading resources (like textures).
	- See 'lazy initialization.'

	play/exec/enter/start
	- Called once as we transition into an application state.
	- Used to reset the logic of the state (ie. new game, reset timers).
	
	exit/stop
	- Called once as we transition out of a state.
	- Used for bookkeeping, not inherently useful.

	term
	- Called once at application shutdown
	- Used to free resources (like textures).
	
	step/update/tick
	- Called once every frame.
	- Used to update logic.
	- Usually we decide to transition to other states from here.

	draw/render
	- Called once every frame.
	- Used to issue draw commands.
